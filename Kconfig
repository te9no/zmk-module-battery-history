      Track battery level over time and store history in persistent storage.
      This allows users to view battery consumption patterns.

    range 24 192
    help
      Maximum number of battery history entries to keep in storage.
      Default is 192 entries (~8 days at 1 hour intervals).
      Lower values reduce flash wear and memory usage.

config ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_INTERVAL_MINUTES
    int "Battery history recording interval in minutes"

    help
      How often to record a battery level entry in minutes.
      Default is 60 minutes (1 hour) to balance accuracy and flash wear.
      Minimum is 15 minutes, maximum is 1440 minutes (24 hours).

config ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_SAVE_THRESHOLD
    int "Number of new entries before saving to persistent storage"
    default 4
    range 1 24
    help
      How many new entries to accumulate before writing to persistent storage.
      Higher values reduce flash write frequency but risk losing data on reset.
      Default is 4 entries (at 1 hour interval, saves every 4 hours).
      This helps extend flash storage life on devices like XIAO nrf52840.
