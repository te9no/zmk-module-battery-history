      Track battery level over time and store history in persistent storage.
      This allows users to view battery consumption patterns.

config ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_STUDIO_RPC
    bool "Enable battery history custom Studio RPC"
    depends on ZMK_STUDIO
    help
      Enable custom RPC protocol to retrieve battery history via ZMK Studio.

config ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES
    int "Maximum number of battery history entries to store"
    default 192
    range 24 192
    help
      Maximum number of battery history entries to keep in storage.
      Default is 192 entries (~8 days at 1 hour intervals).
      Lower values reduce flash wear and memory usage.

config ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_INTERVAL_MINUTES
    int "Battery history recording interval in minutes"
    default 5
    range 1 1440
    help
      How often to check and potentially record a battery level entry in minutes.
      Default is 5 minutes. The guard logic reduces actual writes by skipping
      records when battery level hasn't changed significantly.
      Minimum is 1 minute, maximum is 1440 minutes (24 hours).

config ZMK_BATTERY_HISTORY_SAVE_LEVEL_THRESHOLD
    int "Battery level change threshold for saving (percentage)"
    default 2
    range 1 10
    help
      Save to persistent storage when battery level has dropped by this percentage
      since the last save. Default is 2%, meaning save triggers when battery
      drops 2% from the last saved level. This balances data freshness with
      flash wear reduction.
